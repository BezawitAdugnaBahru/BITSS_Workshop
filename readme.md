# BITSS Research Transparency Workshop
I am making some changes now.

I am now going to save to see changes in Git desktop app.
Now i saw the changes.

Ok. Now i am going to take it to the second level by comiting, to see what exactly changed, in blue what is added and red what is deleted. SO i created a commit in Git.

This is my line of code after commit.Ok i have not seen the cahnges but i hope to be able to changes now, becouse i switch over to ATOM.



Add a line from Git. You could also do that from another computer or a colleage could make this change. 

We will create a conflict here from the cloud.
